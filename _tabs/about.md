# Hey, I'm Shriyans Sudhi! 👋

So, I'm just this high school dude from India who's kinda obsessed with web app security. 🛡️ You know, keeping those digital places safe and sound?

### Bug Busting Ninja 🐞

Oh, and I'm into this bug bounty hunting thing on [HackerOne/@shriyanss](http://hackerone.com/shriyanss). Currently, I'm sitting at a cool 479 points (and counting!). Finding those sneaky bugs is like a treasure hunt, but in cyberspace!

### Project Playground 💡

When I'm not chasing bugs, you can find me messing around with all sorts of projects over on [GitHub/@shriyanss](https://github.com/shriyanss). Seriously, there's always something brewing over there!

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to drop a line, collaborate, or just shoot the breeze. Let's make the web safer and more awesome together! 🚀
